Set your goals and work towards them step by step! Simply add your tasks and give them a deadline. Anybody who has permission to view Tasks can see your tasks and their deadlines. You can mark tasks completed (task is done), pending (not done yet) or inactive (greyed out). <i style="color: #00CC00">Do you have a feature request, or simply need some help?

Create, edit or remove tasks from within the extensions menu. Check off completed tasks on your dashboard. Dashboard Tasks will give each task a color, depending on the status and deadline of your task. These are the status colors of your tasks:</br></br>
                                <b>1.</b>&nbsp; A task will not be given a specific color if it has been set to pending and has not been completed yet.</br></br>
                                <b>2.</b>&nbsp; <span style="color: #CCCCCC;">Greyed out</span> - A task will be greyed out when it\'s set to inactive from within your extensions menu.</br></br>
                                <b>3.</b>&nbsp; <span style="color: #00CC00;">Green marked</span> - A task will be marked green if it has been completed. No further action is required.</br></br>
                                <b>4.</b>&nbsp; <span style="color: #FF0000;">Red marked</span> - A task will be marked red if its deadline has passed and it has not yet been completed.</br></br>
                                Uncompleted tasks will be marked with a <span class="fa fa-exclamation-mark"></span> symbol if their deadline has passed and the task has not been completed yet. This also works for inactive tasks.';
